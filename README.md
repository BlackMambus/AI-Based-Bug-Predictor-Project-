# AI-Based-Bug-Predictor-Project-

An AI-Based Bug Predictor is a cutting-edge tool designed to proactively identify potential software bugs before they wreak havoc in production. It uses machine learning algorithms trained on historical code repositories, bug reports, and patterns to pinpoint risky segments of code or flag logic that might lead to future issues.

⚙️ Key Functionalities:

Code Pattern Recognition: Learns from past coding mistakes to detect similar vulnerabilities in new code.

Predictive Alerts: Notifies developers about possible bugs during code writing or prior to deployment.

Integration with IDEs: Works inside popular code editors to give real-time suggestions and warnings.

Severity Estimation: Classifies potential bugs by impact level—minor glitches to major crashes.

Natural Language Parsing: Analyzes documentation and comments to cross-reference intent vs implementation.
